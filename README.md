While `HTML` and `CSS` control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the `JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures` Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of `JavaScript` including `variables`, `arrays`, `objects`, `loops`, and `functions`.

Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate `strings`, `factorialize numbers`, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: *Object Oriented Programming (OOP)* and *Functional Programming (FP)*.

### Basic JavaScript

`JavaScript` is a `scripting language` you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with `HTML` and `CSS`, and is supported by all modern **`browsers`**.

This repo contains the tasks for learn and practice the fundamental programming concepts in `JavaScript`. Starting with basic `data structures` like `numbers` and `strings`. Then learn to work with `arrays`, `objects`, `functions`, `loops`, `if/else statements`, and more.

---

### ES6

`ECMAScript`, or `ES`, is a **standardized version** of `JavaScript`. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms `ECMAScript` and `JavaScript` are interchangeable.

Most of the `JavaScript` you've learned up to this point was in **`ES5 (ECMAScript 5)`**, which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in `ES5`, 
`JavaScript` is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

`ES6`, **released** in **2015**, added many powerful new features to the language. This repo contains the tasks for learn and practice these `new features`, including `arrow functions`, `destructuring`, `classes`, `promises`, and `modules`.

---

### Regular Expressions

`Regular expressions`, often shortened to **"regex"** or **"regexp"**, are patterns that help programmers `match`, `search`, and `replace` text. 
Regular expressions are very **powerful**, but can be hard to read because they use `special characters` to make more complex, flexible matches.

This repo contains the tasks for learn how to use `special characters`, `capture groups`, `positive and negative lookaheads`, and other techniques to match any text you want.

---

### Debugging

`Debugging` is the process of going through your code, finding any `issues`, and `fixing` them.

Issues in code generally come in `three forms`: `syntax errors` that prevent the program from running, `runtime errors` where the code have unexpected behavior, 
or `logical errors` where the code doesn't do what you intended.

This repo contains the tasks for learn how to use the `JavaScript console` to debug programs and prevent common `issues` before they happen.

---

### Basic Data Structures

`Data` can be `stored` and `accessed` in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript `data structures` — `arrays` and `objects`.

Learn more about the `differences` between `arrays` and `objects`, and which to use in different situations. Also learn how to use helpful `JS methods` like `splice()` and `Object.keys()` to **access** and **manipulate data**.

---

### Basic Algorithm Scripting

An `algorithm` is a series of `step-by-step instructions` that describe how to do something.

To write an `effective` algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.

This repo contains the tasks for learn the fundamentals of `algorithmic thinking` by writing `algorithms` that do everything from converting temperatures to handling `complex 2D arrays`.

---

### Object Oriented Programming

`OOP`, or `Object Oriented Programming`, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, `objects` and `classes` organize code to describe things and what they can do.

This repo contains the tasks for learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the this keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance.

---

### Functional Programming

`Functional Programming` is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into `smaller`, `basic functions` that can be combined to build `complex programs`.

This repo contains the tasks for learn the `core` concepts of Functional Programming including `pure` functions, how to avoid `mutations`, and how to write cleaner code with methods like `.map()` and `.filter()`.

---

### Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

Test `skills` with the `Intermediate Algorithm Scripting` *challenges*.

---

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Time to work**. These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges have done before – just much more difficult.
	* Complete these `5 JavaScript projects`.
